### Hi There ðŸ‘‹
I am a student who is independently trying to learn how to code. My interests lie between hardware/software, I started coding through Arduino and have since moved on to microcontrollers in general. I also know python and am going to try to move in the direction of penetration testing. The third language I know (its not much) is shell script, which I have gotten much better at since publishing my first scripts on GitHub (XD please donâ€™t judge).
