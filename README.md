### Hi There ðŸ‘‹
I am a student who is independently trying to learn how to code. My interests lie between hard/software, I started coding through Arduino and have since moved on to microcontrollers in general (coding with C++, do not know much C++ outside of that area). I also know python and am going to try to move in the direction of machine learning, although that is still far off at that point. The third language I know (its not much) is shell script, which I have gotten much better at since publishing my first scripts on GitHub (XD please donâ€™t judge). I donâ€™t have any definitive plans for the future, just a sense for direction, Iâ€™m going to continuing learning more and advancing my skills.
